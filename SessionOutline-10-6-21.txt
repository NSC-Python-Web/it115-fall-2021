Phase One
each group must pick its leader
the leader will create a group project repository on his/her GitHub account
the leader will invite all other group members to collaborate on that repository
each group member will contribute one of more files to the group's repository
the group leader manages this process 
Phase Two
I will invite each group leader to collaborate on https://github.com/rbunge-nsc/hello-world

Each group leader will upload his/her team's collective files to the hello-world class repository
I will manage this process and take corrective actions when needed (I'm the "Product Owner" of hello-world.)
Summary
in each group, code goes to the repository under the direction of the leader
for the larger class project, each group's code comes from the leader to the class repository under my direction.
Assignment 2: Build a Wiki as a Team
someone in each group needs to start a wiki on his/her GitHub account
this does NOT need to be the same person as the leader for Practice in Class
the wiki host invites the rest of the team to collaborate in the wiki's repository
each team member needs to write at least one page
following the assignment instructions, each student is going to send me the URL where his/her wiki page can be found
this implies that members of a team are each going to send me the same URL their team is using for the wiki. This is expected.
In each student's individual Dropbox submission for this assignment, she/he is going make a statement highlighting her/his wiki page contribution to the overall group wiki.
